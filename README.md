# Simulation Study of Cochlear Implants Stimulation Protocols and Its Application to Surgical Planning
## Scientifical communication project Lab1: Code publication

Welcome to the repository for the bachelor's degree thesis titled "Simulation Study of Cochlear Implants Stimulation Protocols and Its Application to Surgical Planning.", that was performed by Hector Dejea i Velardo on 2015.
This readme file provides an overview of the project, its goals, and the resources available in this repository.


## Introduction
Cochlear implants have revolutionized the field of auditory prosthetics by providing a solution for individuals with severe to profound hearing loss. These implantable devices bypass the damaged parts of the inner ear and stimulate the auditory nerve directly, allowing users to perceive sound. However, the optimal stimulation protocols for cochlear implants can vary among individuals, and determining the most effective parameters for each patient remains a challenge.


The goal of this thesis project is to conduct a comprehensive simulation study of different cochlear implant stimulation protocols. By using computational models and simulations, we aim to investigate the impact of various parameters, such as electrode placement, stimulation levels, and pulse characteristics, on the perception of sound in cochlear implant users. Furthermore, we will explore how these findings can be applied to improve surgical planning for cochlear implantation procedures.

## State of the art
The procedure followed to obtain the simulation and results on this work was:

**Design of the models of the cochlea from cadaverical samples:** Hector firstly modelled the chocleas from different cadaveric simples, since we are all different the structures of our choclea may be diverse, so he tried to obtain the máximum number of samples that he could get.




 **Mesh**: Once Hèctor obatined all the models he did the emsh of the different structures that form the cochlea and also he designed the boundary conditions to perform the simulations by using the finite element methodology.
 Here we have some of the equations that Hèctor used, in this case the Maxwell's equations.

**Results**: The `results` directory contains the outcomes of the simulations and analysis. It includes visualizations, graphs, and any statistical findings obtained during the research.


**Documentation**: The `documentation` directory consists of additional documentation related to the project, such as the thesis paper, research methodology, and any supplementary materials.


## Getting Started
To replicate the simulations or explore the findings of this project, please refer to the specific instructions provided in the respective directories. Make sure to have the required dependencies installed and follow the guidelines for proper data handling and analysis.

## Code
The code that is published on this repository is the sample code that we can find on the home page of Github, since I couldn't have any access to the code used for performing the different simulations.
